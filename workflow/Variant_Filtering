For the variant filtering and prioritization process, we used some cut off for focused on rare variants, and
For Population Allele frequency, selected variants less than:
Homozygous : 5x10-3
Heterozygous :  5x10-5
Compound heterozygous : 5x10-3

Also, beginning of the analysis, coding region variants were examined as it has a higher potential to be causal.

We didn't use a selection method for in-silico predictors via eliminating variants, like CADD > 15 etc.
because to minimize the chance of missing candidate variants.
