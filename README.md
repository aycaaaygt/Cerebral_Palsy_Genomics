# Cerebral_Palsy_Genomics
Our project, supported by TÃ¼bitak 1001, includes workflow diagram and statistics of results of the exome  analyses in Turkish CP cohort.
The patient data used cannot be shared due to the Personal Data Protection Authority, but the developed workflow starts to be processed with fastq data.
The variant filtering and prioritization criteria we use in our analysis are available in the workflow chart.
